#  「 ✦ Introduction ✦ 」

Hello, I'm Hayat Mazlin, a 25 year old french Beginner developer.
In 2023 I passed the selection to join the ZONE01 formation in Rouen, Normandy and started it in November of the same year as a complete beginner in this field.
I should start as a Full Stack Junior developer by the end of 2025.

As a Beginner developer I'm starting to learn, about :
— Go language development
— Imperative programming
— Structured programming
— Algorithms (basics)
— Infrastructure: network and security (basics)

In a few months, as an Apprentice developer I'll dive into :
— Event-driven programming
— Web architecture and tech: HTML, CSS
— JavaScript & Node.js
— Backend programming in Go & JS
— Infrastructure: system administration, network, security (intermediate)
— Algorithms (intermediate)
— Software security (basics)

## ‧₊˚✧ [ What I'm interested in ] ✧˚₊‧

The formation offers me the chance to learn about Artificial Intelligence, Video Games, Mobile Applications, Cybersecurity, Blockchain & Crypto, UI-UX, in a year i'll get to choose a branch to learn about in more details.
I'm currently thinking about specializing in Video Games, Mobile Applications and UI-UX as for now they seem more appealing to me. But as I keep learning I may change my mind.
